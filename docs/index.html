        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub actions</a> allow
          you to run scripts for your repository without having to use
          applications. This is my early exploration of what is possible with
          GitHub actions and npm. There are heaps of alternatives, so make sure
          to try them out!
        </p>
        <p>
          To follow along you will need to <a href="https://github.com/features/actions/signup/">sign up</a> to the GitHub actions beta.

        <h2>Publishing workflow</h2>
        <p>
          I have some npm packages with specific workflow I always follow before
          deploying a new version. My usual workflow for publishing npm packages
          is to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a Pull Request into main</li>
          <li>Merge the pull request into main</li>
          <li>Checkout main branch locally</li>
          <li>Install dependencies <code>npm install</code></li>
          <li>Test the functionality <code>npm run test</code></li>
          <li>
            Publish the package to the npm registry <code>npm publish</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            If any of these steps fail I don't want to publish the package
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>With GitHub actions I can change the workflow to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a Pull Request into any branch</li>
          <li>Run GitHub actions</li>
          <li>
            If any of the actions fail I will get <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-required-status-checks">failed checks</a> in the Pull Request
          </li>
          <li>Merge the pull request</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Create a main.workflow</h2>
        <p>
          To use GitHub actions you need to create a
          <code>.github/main.workflow</code> file in your main branch. This
          file tells GitHub you have a workflow to run. You can do this by
          creating the file in your repository or clicking the actions tab in
          GitHub.
        </p>
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have the file created we need to add a workflow. To create
          workflow we need:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Workflow name: <strong>Build, test and publish on main</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The action to finish the workflow on: <strong>["Test"]</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a href="https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#events-supported-in-workflow-files">event</a> to run the workflow: <strong>push</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A push event is ran when a push to a repository branch is made. Branch
          pushes and repository tag pushes also trigger webhook push events.
        </p>
        <pre>

          <img
            src="/assets/blog/workflow.jpg"
            alt="Screenshot of how to create a workflow in the GitHub user interface"
          />
        </p>
        <h2>Actions</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we have a workflow created we can create our actions. Actions
          are <a href="https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#using-a-dockerfile-image-in-an-action">docker containers</a> that use arguments, secrets and environment variables with the files
          in your repository. To create an action for publish we need:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the action: <strong>Install dependencies</strong></li>
          <li>
            The docker container: <strong><a href="https://github.com/actions/npm">actions/npm@main</a></strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The arguments to pass to the container: <strong>install</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
					<code>
					</code>
				</pre>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Note: you will need the word <code>run</code> before custom npm
            scripts.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We now have a new workflow that runs for every push into the
          repository. It will create a docker container using
          <a href="https://github.com/actions/npm">actions/npm@main</a> and
          run <code>npm install</code> then <code>npm run test</code>. If the
          install and test pass the workflow resolves successfully.
        </p>
        <h2>Publishing when pushed to main</h2>
        <p>
          Lets add some more actions for install, test and filtering for the
          main branch. We will use the
          <a href="https://github.com/actions/bin/tree/main/filter">actions/bin/filter@main</a> to make sure we are in the main branch before running the publish
          action. The publish action will need a secret <code>NPM_AUTH_TOKEN</code> to publish to the NPM registry, you can <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens">create an npm token here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Lets update our workflow to include filtering and publishing.</p>
        <pre>
					<code>
					</code>
				</pre>
        <p>
          And thats it! You now have a simple workflow to publish your npm
          packages.
        </p>
