# Site template

> ðŸ§ª Minimal static site template for prototyping

## Get started

To get started make sure you have the latest version of `nodejs` and `npm` installed. Then run:
```
npm i && npm run watch
```

This will create a local browser-sync instance live refreshing all the changes to the `index.html` and `./assets/*`.
